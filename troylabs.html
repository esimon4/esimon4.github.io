    <div class="subhead">What is TroyLabs?</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        TroyLabs is a student-run startup accelerator at the University of Southern California. Each semester, we help 5 hand-picked Trojan startups ‚Äî those founded by undergraduates, graduates, or alumni ‚Äî transform their MVPs into seed round ready products and services. Each semester culminates with LAUNCH, a live event where founders pitch their companies in front of a panel of VC reps.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">My Role & Responsibilites</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        At TroyLabs, I serve as a UX/UI Design Consultant and a member of TroyLabs‚Äôs internal design team. In essence, my responsibilties are 2-fold.

        <ol>
            <li>Consult with companies inside of the TroyLabs BUILD accelerator to build and improve their UX & UI ‚Äî be it for mobile apps, web apps, marketing website, or whatever else they may need.</li>
            <li>Generate original design and marketing content for TroyLabs. Most notably, I am in the process of re-organizing and re-designing TroyLab‚Äôs main marketing website.</li>

    <div class="subhead">Identfiying the Problem</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        TroyLabs has ambitious goals to become the flagship entrepuenarial organization within the USC community, but it has recently been stifled by communication issues. Something we hear time and time again is ‚Äî ‚Äúwhat exactly does TroyLabs do? I don‚Äôt understand it.‚Äù 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        In truth, TroyLabs does a little bit of everything ‚Äî it is an accelerator, a pitch-competition host, an online community for start-up curious Trojans, an aspiring VC fund, and a late-stage start-up consultant. So the problem became, with TroyLabs‚Äôs far-reaching initiatives, how can we communicate what exactly TroyLabs is in a succint and concrete manner?
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">

        The old website is oudated and confusing ‚Äî it certainly doesn‚Äôt help fix TroyLabs‚Äôs communication problem. So we figured that would be a god place to start.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Mapping the Solution</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        In order to solve TroyLabs‚Äôs communication problems, we set out build a user experience that was easy to navigate and communicated TroyLabs‚Äôs on-campus efforts in a clear, easily digestible manner. We compartmentalized our approach in three ways:
    </div>
    <div class="uxmap">
        <div class="uxcontainer">
            <div class="uxhead">What?</div>
            <div class="uxtext">
                What does TroyLabs do? What are its various programs and what do they offer?
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="uxcontainer">
            <div class="uxhead">Why?</div>
            <div class="uxtext">
                Why get involved/apply for TroyLabs? What are its unique value props for Trojan founders?
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="uxcontainer">
            <div class="uxhead">How?</div>
            <div class="uxtext">
                How does one get involved with TroyLabs? How do they navigate the application proccess?
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Thinking Big Picture</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Using this general structure as a jumping-off point, we mapped out how the site‚Äôs content would be organized.
    </div>
    <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" id="tlmap" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F7JsDdazhOZco2vBiELSMAE%2FTroyLabs-Website-Mapping%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <div class="subhead">Hero Design</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        From there, I started with the high-fidelity design of the homepage. I began with the hero. 
    </div>
</div>

<div id="landingpagebackground">
    <div id="landingpagecontainer">
        <img src="tl1.png" class="landingpages">
        <img src="tl2.png" class="landingpages">
        <img src="tl3.png" class="landingpages">
    </div>
</div>

<div id="textcontainer2">
    <div class="ptext">
        My goal was to give the sterile branding a humanizing touch. Platforming past founders that TroyLabs has worked with not only made the branding more personal and inviting, but immediately offered an answer to TroyLab‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        Outside of founder pictures, I tried to keep the hero‚Äôs design as simple and as easy to digest as possible. The site is, after all, a simple marketing website. The goal is to provide clarity and showcase  ‚Äî I felt as if overly-complicated visuals would take away from that.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Homepage Prototype</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        After finalizing the hero, I moved onto to prototyping the rest of the home page. I added some basic interactivity for clarity when the design is passed off to the devs, but for the most part I kept the page static.
    </div>

        <source src="tlfinalproto.mp4">
    </video>
    <div class="ptext">
        Beyond the homepage, the rest of the website is still under construction. Updates to come soon!
