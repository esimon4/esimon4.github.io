    <div class="subhead">What is TroyLabs?</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        TroyLabs is a student-run startup accelerator at the University of Southern California. Each semester, we help 5 hand-picked Trojan startups — those founded by undergraduates, graduates, or alumni — transform their MVPs into seed round ready products and services. Each semester culminates with LAUNCH, a live event where founders pitch their companies in front of a panel of VC reps.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">My Role & Responsibilites</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        At TroyLabs, I serve as a UX/UI Design Consultant and a member of TroyLabs’s internal design team. In essence, my responsibilties are 2-fold.

        <ol>
            <li>Consult with companies inside of the TroyLabs BUILD accelerator to build and improve their UX & UI — be it for mobile apps, web apps, marketing website, or whatever else they may need.</li>
            <li>Generate original design and marketing content for TroyLabs. Most notably, I am in the process of re-organizing and re-designing TroyLab’s main marketing website.</li>
        </ol>

    <div class="ptext">
        In January of 2022, in conjuction TroyLabs’s internal design team, I began work on re-vamping TroyLabs’s main website. TroyLabs’s website was the primary platform that prospective members, companies, and interested VCs could learn more, apply for, and engage with TroyLabs initiatives.

        While the design is still under construction (we dont anticpipate a formal launch for at least 3-4 weeks), this post will showcase the progress I have made up until this point.

    <div class="subhead">Identfiying the Problem</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        TroyLabs has ambitious goals to become the flagship entrepuenarial organization within the USC community, but it has recently been stifled by communication issues. Something we hear time and time again is — “what exactly does TroyLabs do? I don’t understand it.” 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        In truth, TroyLabs does a little bit of everything — it is an accelerator, a pitch-competition host, an online community for start-up curious Trojans, an aspiring VC fund, and a late-stage start-up consultant. So the problem became, with TroyLabs’s far-reaching initiatives, how can we communicate what exactly TroyLabs is in a succint and concrete manner?
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">

        The old website is oudated and confusing — it certainly doesn’t help fix TroyLabs’s communication problem. So we figured that would be a god place to start.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Mapping the Solution</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        In order to solve TroyLabs’s communication problems, we set out build a user experience that was easy to navigate and communicated TroyLabs’s on-campus efforts in a clear, easily digestible manner. We compartmentalized our approach in three ways:
    </div>
    <div class="uxmap">
        <div class="uxcontainer">
            <div class="uxhead">What?</div>
            <div class="uxtext">
                What does TroyLabs do? What are its various programs and what do they offer?
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="uxcontainer">
            <div class="uxhead">Why?</div>
            <div class="uxtext">
                Why get involved/apply for TroyLabs? What are its unique value props for Trojan founders?
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="uxcontainer">
            <div class="uxhead">How?</div>
            <div class="uxtext">
                How does one get involved with TroyLabs? How do they navigate the application proccess?
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Thinking Big Picture</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Using this general structure as a jumping-off point, we mapped out how the site’s content would be organized.
    </div>
    <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" id="tlmap" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F7JsDdazhOZco2vBiELSMAE%2FTroyLabs-Website-Mapping%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <div class="subhead">Hero Design</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        From there, I started with the high-fidelity design of the homepage. I began with the hero. 
    </div>
</div>

<div id="landingpagebackground">
    <div id="landingpagecontainer">
        <img src="tl1.png" class="landingpages">
        <img src="tl2.png" class="landingpages">
        <img src="tl3.png" class="landingpages">
    </div>
</div>

<div id="textcontainer2">
    <div class="ptext">
        My goal was to give the old site's sterile branding a humanizing touch. Platforming past founders that TroyLabs has worked with not only made the branding more personal and inviting, but immediately offered an answer to TroyLab’s “what” and “why.”
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        Outside of founder pictures, I tried to keep the hero’s design as simple and as easy to digest as possible. The site is, after all, a simple marketing website. The goal is to provide clarity and showcase  — I felt as if overly-complicated visuals would take away from that.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Homepage Prototype</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        After finalizing the hero, I moved onto to prototyping the rest of the home page. I added some basic interactivity for clarity when the design is passed off to the devs, but for the most part I kept the page static.

        Beyond the homepage, the rest of the website is still under construction. Updates to come soon!

    <div class="subhead" id="subhead2"><em>Project 2: UX/UI Start-Up Consulting</em></div>

    <div class="subhead">Overview</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Each semester, TroyLabs takes a cohort of five USC-founded startups and puts them through an 8-week accelerator program called BUILD. The start-ups enter BUILD with a raw MVP and leave ready to begin fundraising. Across those 8-weeks, we help founders refine their go-to market strategies, optimize their technology stacks, improve their UX and UI, and ensure their pitches are VC-ready.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        I served as a UX/UI consultant in the Fall of 2021. Across the course of the semester, I would meet with each company in the accelerator (at least) once a week to discuss, review, and iterate on their product design and brand’s digital presence.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        For companies developing software, this could mean macro adjustments such as re-thinking specific user journies or tweaking the UX of certain features. For other companies, particulary those developing physical products, my role often entailed re-tooling landing pages or altering the company’s brand identity.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        Outside of design, I consulted on general business development, marketing strategies, and pitch approaches.
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Takeaway #1 — How to Critique & Speak Design</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        When consulting on design at TroyLabs, I was rarely ever in the driver’s seat. I wasn’t generating my own designs or mapping out my own user experiences. I was instead mostly critiquing existing digital experiences — be it marketing websites or more complex web apps.    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        Design is a kind of intuitive skill — often something looks or feels off and it’s hard to articulate why or how it could be improved. I wasn’t hopping on Figma myself to manually change anything, so I instead had to find the words to describe just why or how specific design choices didn’t make sense. 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        Describing a certain color scheme as “off” wasn’t enough. I instead had to articulate how that color scheme made me feel, why that feeling wasn’t cohesive with a company’s brand presence, and how it could be improved. I had to find examples on dribbble and Pinterest to illustrate effective uses of gradients and shadows. Consulting and critiquing design pushed me to develop the rhetorical arsenal to offer productive and effective feedback. It also taught me to be purposeful, specific, and concrete when collaborating with others on a design — vauge adjectives didn’t cut it.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        I also learned, especially when thinking about more macro UX issues, the about power of sketching — no matter how crappy of an artist you may be. Some of the features I helped work on were complex and included dozens of steps and instances. It was always productive to take a step back and map out user journeys with a pad and pencil before jumping into suggestions on how to make things more accessible and easy-to-use.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Takeaway #2 — Always Come Back to the User</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        One of the biggest mistakes I saw during my time at BUILD was companies prioritizing aesthetics at the expense of usability. I found companies often  opting for complex animations and user interactivity that obscured the reachability of end transactions — such as purchasing a product, signing up for a newsletter, or applying for a waitlist.    
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        I found it helpful to encourage founders to think about the different types of users who would be visting their website or using their product. What would they be hoping to do once they log on? From there, I helped different companies think about and flesh out 2-3 distinct user profiles — who the users are and what they want to do.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        In the end, it was helpful to land on 2-3 primary end transactions that each distinct user may desire. Once we decided those transactions, I emphasized the importance that they should always be at most 3 clicks away from any page or location on a site or app. If users had to click more than 3 times, the transaction was inacessible.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        I found this concrete approach effective to help founders re-think their approach to UX and consistently come back to the user when designing.
