    <div class="subhead">Overview</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Based out of Philadelphia, Honeybis produces, manufactures, and sells CBD-infused honey products. During the summer of 2021, I worked alongside a full-stack developer to research, design, and develop an e-commerce landing page for the company to advertise and sell their products online.

    <div class="subhead">Identifying the problem</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Honeybis was entering a saturated market rife with misinformation and negative stigma. As such, Honeybis’s problems were two-fold:

        <ol>
            <li>Differentiating their product from the competitive landscape</li>
            <li>Overcoming negative stigma surrounding cannabis and CBD</li>
        </ol>
        
        The question became — <strong>how can we craft a professional brand identity that will inspire trust in consumers while also helping Honeybis stand out from competitors?</strong>
    </div>

    <div class="subhead">Mapping the solution</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        In order to solve Honeybis’s problem, we set out to build a user experience that communicated Honeybis’s product in a succint manner. We compartmentalized our approach into three sections:
    </div>

    <div class="uxmap">
        <div class="uxcontainer">
            <div class="uxhead">What?</div>
            <div class="uxtext">
                What exactly does Honeybis sell? What is CBD honey and what does it do?
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="uxcontainer">
            <div class="uxhead">Why?</div>
            <div class="uxtext">
                Why buy CBD honey? What are its benefits? What makes Honeybis stand-out from competitors?
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="uxcontainer">
            <div class="uxhead">How?</div>
            <div class="uxtext">
                How do you use CBD honey? What does its application look like on a day-to-day basis?
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ptext">
        We decided if we could clearly communicate the answers to these three sets of questions, we would effectively highlight Honeybis’s unique value prop while alleviating  concerns potential consumers may have about purchasing cannabis products in the first place.
    </div>

    <div class="subhead">Building visitor profiles</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        After speaking with Honeybis’s founders, we next  considered common visitor profiles — what types of people would be visiting Honeybis’s page? What would they be looking to get out of the website? We came up with three primary profiles.
    </div>

    <div class="profilecontainer">

        <div class="profile" id="head">
            <div class="rightsideprof">
                <div class="uxtext2">
                    Visitor
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="leftsideprof">
                <div class="uxtext2">
                    End Transaction
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="profile">
            <div class="profpanel" class="rightsideprof">
                <div class="uxhead">Return Customer</div>
                <div class="uxtext1">
                    Has already decided they desire to purchase the product, on the site just to buy it.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="profpanel" class="leftsideprof">
                <div class="uxhead">Shop Page</div>
                <div class="uxtext1">
                    Return customers will want to access the shop page as easily and quickly as possible.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="profile">
            <div class="profpanel" class="rightsideprof">
                <div class="uxhead">Wholesaler</div>
                <div class="uxtext1">
                    Looking to purchase Honeybis product in bulk at a discount.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="profpanel" class="leftsideprof">
                <div class="uxhead">Contact</div>
                <div class="uxtext1">
                    Since wholesalers will not be able to use the shop, they will need to contact Honeybis.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="profile">
            <div class="profpanel" class="rightsideprof">
                <div class="uxhead">Prospective Customer</div>
                <div class="uxtext1">
                    Has not yet decided if they want to purchase the product — has interest but still on the fence.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="profpanel" class="leftsideprof">
                <div class="uxhead">Learn More</div>
                <div class="uxtext1">
                    Prospects are looking to learn more about Honeybis and CBD products at large (FAQ, benefits, etc.)
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ptext">
        Our goal was to make these three “transactions” — shop, contact, and learn more — as accessible and intuitive as possible.
    </div>

    <div class="subhead">Low-fi wireframing</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Next, we drafted a low-fidelity wireframe. The low-fi wireframe acted as the site’s blueprint — dictating which information would be displayed and in what order. The wireframe was to be a rough guide, and we designed it with the understanding that the nitty-gritty design details would be subject to change.     
    </div>

    <img src="lowfi.svg" id="lowfi">

    <div class="ptext">
        When building out the wireframe, it was integral to not lose sight of the why behind our decisions. Our goal was to tie every section back to one of the three essential questions — what, why, and how? 
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="ptext">
        For example, the hero would speak to the “what” — what Honeybis sells, what it looks like, what it does. The health benefits section and social proof spoke to the “why” — why incorporate CBD oil into your daily routines? Why Honeybis in particular over other brand alternatives. The use cases section spoke to the “how” — how to use Honeybis oils on a day to day basis.
    </div>

    <div class="subhead">Branding & design language</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Next, we began to build out brand guidelines and brainstorm design language ideas. We started with competitors in the space — how did other companies producing CBD honey look? 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        It didn’t take us long to identify a pattern. Most of the competitive landscape boasted warm, friendly, and organic branding palettes. The colors were vibrant yellows and oranges, the fonts were playful serifs. 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        With this in mind, we opted instead for a minimal, sleek, and modern design approach. Our decision here was two-fold. One — borrowing from popular design trends will allow Honeybis to establish immediate rapport with customers. People tend to intuitively trust what’s familiar. Two — sleek and minimal branding positioned Honeybis uniquely against its maximal, warm, and cozy competitive landscape.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Landing page sprint</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        After getting a general understanding of Honeybis’s branding and design language, I came up with three different landing pages concepts for the client to choose from.  
    </div>
</div>

<div id="landingpagebackground">
    <div id="landingpagecontainer">
        <img src="landingpage1.png" class="landingpages">
        <img src="landingpage2.png" class="landingpages">
        <img src="landingpage3.png" class="landingpages">
    </div>
</div>

<div id="textcontainer">
    <div class="ptext">
        After reviewing the mockups with the Honeybis team, we elected to proceed with the middle design and dark, frosted UI.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">3-D Model</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        The Honeybis team expressed interest in developing a 3D model of their product jar that would move as the page scrolled, similar to Apple’s iPhone landing page. 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        To achieve this, I began with storyboarding the overall flow of the animation.
    </div>

    <div id="storyboard">
        <div class="storyboardrow">
            <img src="Transition.png" class="storyimg">
            <img src="Benefit 1.png" class="storyimg">
        </div>
        <div class="storyboardrow">
            <img src="Benefit 2.png" class="storyimg">
            <img src="Benefit 3.png" class="storyimg">
        </div>
        <div class="storyboardrow">
            <img src="Benefit 4.png" class="storyimg">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ptext">
        We thought the 3D model to be an engaging medium to showcase benefits and additional information about CBD honey — its interactivity would draw users in and force them to engage with educational content concerining the product.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        After getting a sense of the model’s general flow, my partner mapped out the animation in much greater specificty — detailing how the model would move across various timeframes.
    </div>
    <img id="storyboard2" src="storyboard.png">
    <div class="ptext">
        Once we had finalized the storyboard, we worked with a third party animator to build out the 3-D model. The end animation — which would move forward and backwards as the user scrolled up and down — came out like this:
    </div>
    <video width="800" height="600" name="3D Model Final" id="model" autoplay controls>
        <source src="animation.MOV">
    </video>
    <div class="subhead">Final Prototype</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Between early-stage UX mapping, low-fi wireframing, and getting the 3D model developed, most of the heavy lifting was at this point over with. The next step was to execute on the design language, and create a simple yet aesthetically engaging UI.
    </div>
    <video width="800" height="600" name="3D Model Final" id="model" autoplay controls>
        <source src="finalprototype.mp4">
    </video>
</div>
