    <h1>Whitman Insight Strategies</h1>
    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <div class="subhead">Overview</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Whitman Insight Strategies (WINS) is a market research firm based out of New York City that specializes in studying consumer and voter behavior. At WINS, I worked on exploratory research projects ranging from the care-abouts of Latino dairy consumers to the efficacy of cryptocurrency communication campaigns across racial divides.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        At WINS, the lingering question was always ‚Äúwhy‚Äù ‚Äî why do consumers gravitate more towards one ad spot over the other? Why is a certain product overperforming amongst older males but underperforming amongst younger ones? Why aren‚Äôt people getting vaccinated?
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        WINS used market research data ‚Äî be it in the form of survey responses or focus group conversations ‚Äî to unlock consumer-centric marketing and product strategies for brands, political candidates, and causes.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">My Role & Responsibilities</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        As a summer analyst, I worked alongside full-time analysts to assist in the execution of market research projects. More specifically, my responsibilities included:
        <ol>
            <li>Assisting in the planning, development, and analysis of qualitative and quantitative research projects aimed to identify market and political trends, with clients such as the New York Department of Health, Apple, and Penn State University.</li>
            <li>Facilitated research projects using industry best practices in the qualitative space with focus groups and in-depth interviews, and in the quantitative space with surveys, communications testing, and statistical analysis using Excel, SPSS, and cross-tabular software.</li>
            <li>Leveraging research findings to identify key social, cultural, and economic variables to explain consumer and voter behavior.</li>
        </ol>
        From coding open-ended survey responses to developing and testing questionnaires to aggregating research findings into slide decks, my time at WINS gave me a hands-on understanding of how to conduct research projects that unlock meaningful insights around who is buying your product and why.
    </div>
    <div class="subhead">Takeaway #1 ‚Äî Get to Know Your Users</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Prior to my time at WINS, I figured most companies and startups made marketing and product decisions through more or less internal deliberation. But after working at WINS, I realized that every advertisement, product decision, brand positioning, and design choice is meticulously researched, tested, and iterated upon long before it's available to the public.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        But how exactly do companies research, test, and iterate on these things? By talking to their users. With the help of firms like WINS, trendy crypto startups and established insurance giants alike spend considerable time and money getting to know who exactly is buying their products and using their services.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        What I found particularly interesting was that companies were interested in their users beyond the ways in which they interacted with their products. Apple did not just care about why or how people used ApplePay  ‚Äî they wanted to know about ApplePay users themselves. What are their pain points? What are their hobbies? What motivates them? This comprehensive approach to user research provided a truly holistic understanding of a given set of consumers, allowing companies to make more informed, calculated product decisions.

    <div class="subhead">Takeaway #2 ‚Äî Segmenting the Market</div>
    <div class="ptext">
        Political strategists often make the differentiation between their base versus swing voters versus the opposition. WINS, using their ‚ÄúPolitical Model‚Äù takes a similar approach to market research ‚Äî but instead of voters, they segment between customers.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="ptext">
        Building clear and descriptive user profiles that segment between a product‚Äôs base, swing, and opposition consumers allows companies to make purposeful and informed decisions. Segmenting the consumer landscape allows start-ups and established brands alike to tailor communication, design, and marketing towards the consumers that matter. Activate the base, persuade the swing, ignore the rest.
